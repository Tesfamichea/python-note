Python Variable is containers which store values. 
Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. 
A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. 
It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

Example

Var = "Hello"
print(Var)
