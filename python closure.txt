Closure

A function defined inside another function is called a nested function. Nested functions can access variables of the enclosing scope.

In Python, these non-local variables are read-only by default and we must declare them explicitly as non-local (using nonlocal keyword) in order to modify them.

The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points.

    We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
    The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
    The enclosing function must return the nested function.
Example

    def function_1():
    msg = 'Meghana'
    def function_2():
        msg = 'CodeSpeedy'
        print(msg)
    function_2()
    print(msg)
function_1()
